Put your formulas here
 $x= [ -b +/- sqrt(b^2-4ac) ]/2a$//
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

## Reflection here

## Q1- What aspect of the lab did you find to be the hardest?
## A1- The hardest Part of this lab was generating the graph from Excel as I haven't used it before like that.

## Q2- What do you think about CodeSpaces? What did you like/not like about Codespaces?
## A2- I Really like using codespaces as it is very convinient and easy to use, it helps to code and upload everything really easily and reduces the stress of installing any coding environment and pushing files to github.
