## Part D: Reflection

### Reflection for Ravneet Kaur

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.    
   I did part c of the assignment, i.e. implementing the MinHeap. To begin with, I carefully read the instructions given in the assignment regarding the implementation of       basic functions related to MinHeap which included insertion, extraction of the minimum element, checking if the heap is empty, getting the minimum value, and building the    heap from a given list. Additionally, I implemented methods 'heapify_up' and 'heapify_down' to adjust the heap by moving the elements up or down on insertion or deletion     of heap elements, respectively.
2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?    
   I learnt how to implement the MinHeap, with each node less than or equal to its children. Also, I learnt how to implement basic heap functions without altering the heap      properties.
3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?    
   Something I found the most challenging was the implementation of heapify_up and heapify_down operations, as while coding for these functions I had to make sure that
   heap properties do not change and the newly inserted elements are added at the proper place.
   

### Reflection for Yuvraj Singh

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.

   I did part b of the assignment, which required me to complete two major tasks:

   Creating Graph Structures: I used Python to create two different sorts of graph structures. One of them was the Graph class in which I managed points and connections. The    other one was the LabelGraph class with a unique name assigned to each point.
   I wrote a lot of functions for these classes. These included adding new points, connecting points with lines, and checking how many points and lines were in the graph.
   Testing and Error Correction: I checked these graphs to see whether they were working properly and fix any problems I discovered.

2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?

   This assignment taught me how to create and use graph structures in programming. This is similar to constructing a map, where you set points for locations and draw lines     to indicate how they are linked. It helped me comprehend how objects in the actual world, such as highways connecting cities, may be related.

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?

   The most difficult part was ensuring that the graphs could handle various circumstances correctly. Adding lines or points might be difficult at times, especially in a        labelled graph. To get around this, I ran a slew of tests to figure out where the issues were. When I discovered a bug, I updated the code to solve it. This way, I could     ensure that the graphs worked in all scenarios.
