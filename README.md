# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA456)

Welcome to the repository for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA456)** at Seneca College!

The GitHub repository DSA-Assignments contains assignments for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA456) course at Seneca College. The repository is organized into two main sections: lab_assignments (Lab Assignments 0-7) and final_assignments (Final Assignments 1-3). These assignments cover practical implementations and theoretical concepts, including algorithm analysis, growth rates, custom data structures, P vs NP problems, efficient data retrieval, and graph data structures. The repository includes documentation and is primarily written in Python.
