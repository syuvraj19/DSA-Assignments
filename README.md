# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA456)

This repository contains assignments and projects completed for the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA456)** course at Seneca College.

## Course Overview

**Course Title:** Data Structures and Algorithms  

**Course Description:**  
This course surveys classical data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer programs. Students will learn how these data structures and algorithms operate, their theoretical basis, and their implementation. The course includes a focus on computational theory and provides a fundamental background in computer science concepts.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, I am able to:

- Analyze algorithms and data structures for resource usage to design optimal programs.
- Explain the relationship between resource use growth rates and observed algorithmic behavior to forecast performance.
- Use pseudo code and diagrams to explain how data structures and algorithms are implemented.
- Implement custom data structures to extend the behavior of language-specific libraries.
- Explain the P vs NP problem to recognize the limitations of computation.
- Implement key-based container classes to retrieve data quickly and efficiently.
- Use graph data structures to store information about relationships between objects.
