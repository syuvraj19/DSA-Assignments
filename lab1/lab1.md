Write about your experience programming in Python for this lab. Your reflection should include comments on the following:

Q1- What did you like/not like about Python
A1- I like how easy it is to code in Python, it has high readability, is easy to understand and debug, and Python's extensive library support speeds up development by providing some pre-defined keywords, so it makes it even easier to code in Python. also, Python's cross-platform compatibility ensures code works seamlessly across different systems.

Q2- Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python?
A2- I have a little experience with Python from high school, as I am familiar with it just needed to brush up on some basics like- syntax and alignment issues, as I have been working on C++ for the past two semesters, but I certainly I like the shift to python as it is really convenient to code in it.

Q3- Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program.
A3- In comparison to all the other languages I've studied so far, Python is relatively simpler. Although the fundamental ideas—such as establishing a class and beginning loops—were the same, using Python was simpler. Python makes it simpler to write programs because it doesn't need as much attention to detail as C/C++ did.
