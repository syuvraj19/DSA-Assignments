## Simple sorts

	* which algorithm did you find easiest to understand?
	ANS. The algorith that I found easiest is the Bubble sort.

	* which algorithm seemed to fastest for completing the sort?
	Ans. The Insertion sort seemed to be the fastest for completing the sort.


## Merging Unsorted lists

	* how long did this take
	Ans. It took about 2 min 56 sec.

	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
	Ans. yes I did one mistake by selecting the biggest number first rather than choosing the smallest one becasue list of numbers was too big.	

	* How many times?
	ANS. I did it once only.		

   	
## Merging Sorted lists

	* how long did this take
	Ans. It took about 1 min 30 sec.	

	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
	Ans. No, I didn't make any mistake.

	* How many times?
	Ans. I didn't make any mistake.	

## Sorting larger data sets

|Team member | Sorting time|
|---|---|
| Yuvraj Singh | 1 min 31 sec  |
| Avreet Kaur | 1 min 29 sec |
| Ravneet Kaur | 1 min 53 sec |

What was fastest time?

Ans. The fastest time was 1 min 29 sec.

Describe the algorithm produced by the team member with fastest time.

Ans. The algorithm used by the team member with the fatest time was Insertion sort.


## Partitioning

* how long did it take to partition the data set?

Ans. It took about 2 min 56 sec to partition the data set.


## Sorting the small piles

* how long did it take for you to sort all of the little piles?

Ans. It took about 1 min 42 sec to sort all of the little piles.

## Putting it together

* As a team discuss things that helped soft the papers... what was useful? what was fast to do?  What was slow?

Ans. Every team member was in constant communication with one another. We were able to comprehend the concepts of each and every algorithm technique with the aid of mutual understanding, which was very helpful. It was quick to sort. Bubble sort took a while.

* As a team come up with a description of how best to sort a set of numbers on paper.

Ans. The best way to sort set of numbers on paper is by using Quick sort.

* Mix up all your numbers and have each member of the team perform the sort you did.  How long did it take?

Ans. For Bubble sort:

Time taken by Yuvraj Singh: 2 min 5 sec

Time taken by Ravneet Kaur: 2 min 15 sec

Time taken by Avreet Kaur: 2 min 3 sec


For Selection sort:

Time taken by Yuvraj Singh: 1 min 17 sec

Time taken by Ravneet Kaur: 1 min 15 sec

Time taken by Avreet Kaur: 1 min 27 sec


For Insertion sort:

Time taken by Yuvraj Singh: 1 min 4 sec

Time taken by Ravneet Kaur: 58.67 sec

Time taken by Avreet Kaur: 1 min 00 sec
